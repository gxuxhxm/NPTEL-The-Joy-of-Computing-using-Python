   - C) A node (person) which is visited the maximum times.
   - D) Can not decide.
   *- **Correct Answer: C) A node (person) which is visited the maximum times.***

9. Which of the following is true about directed graphs?
   - A) One can come back and forth from one node to another using a single edge.
   - B) One can only go forward from one node to another using a single edge.
   - C) One can go to any node from one node using one edge.
   - D) None of the above.
   *- **Correct Answer: B) One can only go forward from one node to another using a single edge.***
